What is a hostel?
	</p><p>
A hostel is a low budget accommodation shared among travelers. When a guest books a stay in a hostel, he or she typically books a bed and shares the room with other guests. Hostels stand out against hotels not only for low prices but also for a remarkable emotional atmosphere. Hostels are known as a great way to make friends.

	</p><p>
Foreigners staying in Russia for more than 7 working days need the registration.
So if you come to us from another Russian city you must have either registration in original (proving that you stay in Russia legally ) or train/plane tickets to Vladimir ( proving that your stay in Vladimir is less than 48 hours).<br>If you haven’t got the documents listed above we reserve the right to refuse in accommodation. Russian Visa and migration card is a must for foreigners in Russia.<br>But to stay in a hostel legally over 24hours you must have registration according to law of Russia.<br>You can stay with friends without registration during 7 days, in 7 days you either must register or quit the country.
