What is a hostel?
	</p><p>
A hostel is a low budget accommodation shared among travelers. When a guest books a stay in a hostel, he or she typically books a bed and shares the room with other guests. Hostels stand out against hotels not only for low prices but also for a remarkable emotional atmosphere. Hostels are known as a great way to make friends.
